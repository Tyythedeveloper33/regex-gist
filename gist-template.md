# Title (replace with your title)

A "regex", or better known as "regular expression" is a very good language to match patterns , that are used manipulate text, or even just for searching text. It is very powerful because it allows developers to define patterns of  numbers or characters and apply those patterns to strings of text. using regex it can make things easy for developers when it comes to validating data,extracting information, searching for specific words, etc. 

## Summary

so for my choice of Regex i went with the regular expression for matching a email, in this gist i will start off from the start of the expression when it comes to explaining each element thats included individually, so expect them to be in order in which the order the elements are used. also i will explain what the element is, then how the element is integrated into my regular expression and its purpose in my expression. here is my regex:
              `/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/`
